                    <h2 class="title">Before you get started</h2>
                    <p>There are a few things to bear in mind when starting to plan to construct a custom keyboard. You can modify your keyboard in a variety of ways to make it either more clicky or more thocky. You must determine the size you would like as well as how it feels and appears.
                    </p>
                    <p class="points">
                        You have two options: purchase a prebuilt keyboard and personalise it (which will be less expensive and simpler), or purchase individual pieces to construct your own keyboard. Just be sure that all of your components will be compatible however you decide to do it. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        
                <div class="container-border wrapper">
                    <p>
                        Let's discuss about sizes. There are many various keyboard sizes available, for instance.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="points" >
                    <li>The macropad is a separate component of a keyboard that just has a numeric pad. If they have a tiny keyboard without a number pad, most people do this.</li>
                    <li>40%: No number keys, just your standard keyboard. Although it is fairly portable, there are drawbacks such as the need for a supplementary layer all the time.</li>
                    <li>60: The most popular of the keyboard. This time, it has the number keys but not the arrow keys; the secondary layer will be used as well.</li>
                    <li>65%: It is identical to 60% but includes arrows and additional navigation buttons.</li>
                    <li>75%: this one adds a row for the functions.</li>
                    <li>Tenkeyless (80%): adopts the full-size keyboard's keyboard layout but does away with the number pad.</li>
                    <li>1800 compact (96%): There are no spaces between the keys on this keyboard since all the keys are pushed together.</li>
                    <li>Full sized: a standard keyboard layout with all of the keys (you rarely find this size for custom builds; prebuilt keyboards normally come in this size).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Another consideration is whether to use a hot-swappable PCB or a regular PCB (soldering). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Selecting the appropriate switch for you will be essential to your setup when it comes to sound. There are three distinct switch kinds to pick from. The quietest of the group, Linear, doesn't have an audible click or a tactile bump when you type. The centre ground between the three is tactiles. As opposed to typing, they have more of a click, which would be the tactile bump. The third and last one is Clicky, which is also the loudest. These are designed to type at a loud volume. So consider whether the noise will affect you or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lubricating your switches can also lessen the noise it makes as you type, but we'll cover that in more detail later. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, decide whether you want the PCB to be more user-friendly for beginners or if you already have soldering knowledge and want to get started. All you need to do to use a Hot Swappable PCB is press the switch down into the board. If you want to make changes or correct any mistakes made during customization, you can simply remove the switch. Although stranded PCBs are far more difficult to use, you would need to solder the switches to the PCB and mistakes are possible.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Now that you are aware of a few things, let's begin.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div class="feature-grid container wrapper title-border">
                    <div>   
                        <img class="boxR " src="imgs/Pcb.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div> 
                        <h2>Test the PCB</h2>
                        <p>
                            You should test your PCB first because you don't want to create the entire thing only to discover that it isn't functional. You could do this with a prebuilt keyboard too just to make sure things will be okay.
                        </p>
                        <p>To accomplish this, you must connect your PCB to your computer and test each key. You can do it by making contact with the sockets with tweezers. You can acquire a replacement item from the manufacturer if anything doesn't function.</p>
                    </div> 
                </div> 

                    <div class="container wrapper title-border">
                        <h2>Case</h2>
                        <p>
                            The keyboard's body is the case, which also houses all of your accessories. There are several sorts of material you can choose for the case, such as aluminium, which is seen to be an excellent choice for individuals who want a sturdy case because it tends to be more durable. If you buy RGB lights with your PCB, there is also acrylic, which is significantly lighter and lets light shine through wonderfully. Additionally, wood cases are available, which is very sleek
                        </p>
                    </div>

                                However, you can modify it to change the way your typing sounds. You can add foam to your casing and place o rings on the stand offs on the bottom to reduce the airy sound that occurs when you type. Your typing will feel more solid when the o rings are added.
                            </p>

                                <h2>PCB/Plate</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The next step is to line up your PCB and plate. Since the spacebar and shift keys are probably familiar to you, so lining it up shouldn't be too difficult. You can add a modification that will both lessen sound and improve the sound of your typing before you screw the PCB and the plate together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can add a tape modification by covering the entire back of the PCB with masking tape before attaching your PCB or plate to the casing. This will result in a keyboard sound that is even more poppy. s ome PCBs feature standoffs, you must screw your plate to the PCB before installing it in your case. The PCB needs to be screwed in along with the stand offs that the casing will have. To make it even more durable, you can add o rings between the plate and the case standoffs.
                                </p>

                               <h2>Stabilizers</h2>
                               <p>
                                No matter if you purchase stabilizers or a prebuilt keyboard, they may already be lubricated when they leave the factory. However, you may want to re-lubricate your stabilizers to make them extra smooth and to your preferences if you want to be safe. Adding too much lubrication will cause your keys to cling and become too sticky.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Your stabilizers can have a band aid mod added to them to make them feel even smoother. In order to make the stabilizers less shaky, you may basically cut little strips of fabric bandages and place them on your plate as well as inside the plastic portion of your stabilizesz. The final modification you can make to your stabilizers is to remove the tiny feet that are attached to the bottom of the plastic portion.
                               </p>
                           </div>

                <div class="container wrapper title-border">
                    <h2>Switches</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you want your switches to feel smoother after you've decided on the type—linear, tactile, or clicky—you'll need to lubricate them.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <p>
                            How many pins your PCB can support is one thing you should consider. Switches can have 3 or 5 pins; check your PCB to determine which sort is required. Don't panic if your PCB only supports 3 pins despite your switches having 5 pins. It can be made compatible by removing the two smaller plastic pins with flush cutters or nail clippers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Simply press the switches into the PCB to install them. It is quite simple to bend the pins at the back, so make sure the switches are straight as you push down. And if a pin has bent, using tweezers to straighten it back will work, and the switch should function properly as it should.
                        </p>

                       <p>
                        The keyboard's appearance is determined by the keycaps, which come in a wide variety of styles and price points. It's important to keep in mind that purchasing backlit keycaps is advised if your PCB has RGB LEDs.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The various keycap profiles include SA, OEM, Cherry, XDA, and DSA; you should determine which one best fits your needs and which ones are compatible with your switches.

                    Once it is plugged in or connected via bluetooth, you should check to see if each key functions. Open a text document and try each key or you can go to a keyboard testing website. 
                </p>
                <h2>If it some keys don't work</h2>
                <p>
                    You won't have to take apart the whole keyboard to make your keys work, all that it probably is, is a bent pin. Simply remove the keycap, remove the switch using a switch puller, and bend the pin back. Reposition the switch and check its functionality.
                </p>
