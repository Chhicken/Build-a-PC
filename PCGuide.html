                    <h2>Before you get started</h2>
                    <p>Choose the size of your PC case as your first step. The one thing you should consider is where you'll be placing your computer; whether you want to put it on show or tuck it away, you need consider what size you need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Full-tower, mid-tower, and mini-tower are the 3 sizes available. Since case sizes are not uniform across manufacturers, cases are often based on motherboard size. Therefore, check to see if your motherboard will fit in your case.
                    </p>

                        You should also be aware that there are various CPU kinds, so you should choose the one that is best for your motherboard. Although there are additional options, Intel and AMD are the two main PC manufacturers. The main distinction is that the pins on Intel models are on the socket, whereas the pins on AMD builds are on the CPU.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two different types of coolers for computers: liquid cooling and air cooling. PC air cooling is inexpensive and relatively simple to install. If you want a cheaper computer, air cooling would be the best option because it is the safest and requires the least amount of maintenance. While water cooling is quite prevalent in computers, it is especially made for video games since it enables for CPU and GPU overclocking while maintaining component cooling. Your ability to build a compact computer with high-power components will be made possible by your water cooling system.

                    <p>
                        Before you start buying and building your computer, check sure all of the parts will fit in your case and operate together.

                        <p>
                            The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects every piece of hardware in your computer and enables communication between them all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A reminder that not all CPUs will fit in all motherboards, so make sure you have the appropriate sort of motherboard for your case and CPU.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gather the standoffs that came with your case and locate the ideal location to put them before you begin. Standoffs avoid shorting between your components. Some cases require you to install them manually, while others already have them installed.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="feature-grid container wrapper">
                        <img class="boxL2" src="imgs/Motherboard.png" alt="">

                            <p>
                                The I/O shield will be the following step after you've determined where your standoffs should go. This metal sheet fits into your case and is included with your motherboard. To ensure that your motherboard will go through the holes once both are fitted, you must fit the shield into your case before installing it and make sure it is put correctly. To get the I/O shield inside, you'll need to apply some force.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Make sure your standoffs line up with the motherboard's holes, and that the ports line up with the i/o shield's cutouts. You can screw the motherboard in once you've wiggledÂ everything together. You don't want to tighten the screws too much because doing so could harm your motherboard. To avoid any problems, move in a star pattern.</p>

                            <p>
                                Installing the cpu will be easy if you are careful and double check what you are doing to ensure a smooth install. There is a square metal bracket that holds the cpu in place called that load plate, and it raises and lowers using a lever. To open it press down on the lever and pull it gently to the side away from the socket to open the tray. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                    You can see an arrow in the CPU's corner. Place the CPU in place by aligning this arrow with the load plate's arrow, being careful not to touch the CPU's pins, which could lead to interference from dust and other elements. The majority of CPUs only have one orientation, so check it again if it feels off and give it another shot.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once it has been suitably positioned, firmly press the lever back into position. Although it can require some force to lower the lever, make sure the alignment is correct to ensure a smooth process.
                                </p>

                               <p>
                                Many CPUs come with their own coolers, but they tend to be on the more budget-friendly side. If you wanted a more robust cooler, investing in a better one might be helpful. The majority of individuals would purchase a new one if it made their computer builds quieter or more attractive, such as with rgb lights or other cool features.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                You'll need thermal paste to apply to the CPU. It will either be pre-applied to the cooler or you'll have to buy some that comes in a syringe tube, however I would recommend getting extra to make sure there will be enough for the task. You only need a pea-sized amount, so don't worry.
                               </p>

                            There are various cooler types, some of which have mounting brackets, push pins, and other accessories. To correctly mount your cooler onto your CPU, be sure to read the manual. Once everything is properly put in place, you'll want to plug in your cooler. The port should have three or four pins and connect nearby.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        The location of your RAM depends on how much you purchased; if you only bought one, you'll probably put it in the first available slot, known as A1. You should now insert your two RAM sticks into the A2 and B2 slots if you have them. To be certain of where to install your RAM sticks, consult the instructions for your motherboard.
                    </p>

                            Make sure that the latches for each memory slot are open once you've decided where to put your ram. Depending on the board, latches may be located on either one or both sides. The notches on the open slots and the notches on the bottom of the ram stick should be lined up. When you're ready, you should push down hard; if you do it right, you'll hear a click. Upon hearing a click, check to ensure sure the latches are properly repositioned and appear to be in good condition.

                        You should first take a look around your case to determine the best location for your drive because each case is a little different. Place the drive in the proper slot and secure it with a screw or lock. Once everything is in place, connect the sata power connector to the drive and the sata data line to the motherboard.

                        In order for some ports to be visible, you'll need to remove a few backplates from your case before you can install the GPU. Once it is prepared for installation, insert the GPU into the PCIe X16 slot by gently pushing it in until you hear a click. Connect the PCIe power connector to the GPU using the connector on your power supply.

                        Find the location of the power supply in your case and mount it there; it will probably be at the bottom of the case. Using the included screws, secure the power supply unit. Once it is in, connect the motherboard's 24-pin power connector as well as the supplemental/CPU power connector (keep cable management in mind if you want your pc to look clean)

                    There will be several small cords that come with the casing that must be plugged into the motherboard in order for your computer's buttons to function. The case connections and motherboard both have appropriate symbols for connecting the cables, which have positive and negative signs on them. Connect them by matching them up.
                </p>
                <h2>Double check</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you've got everything in order, simply go through a check list once more to ensure that everything was done correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>Turn on and installing operating system</h2>
                <p>
                    Before closing up the case, turn on the power switch on the power supply after plugging it in. You've finished when it turns on, the fans start to run, and the motherboard logo appears on the monitor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's very easy to install the system; all you have to do is choose the system and put it on a USB drive. This should direct you to a page where you can download your operating system, and it will guide you through the process.
                </p>
                <h2>If it didn't boot up right</h2>
                <p>
                    If it didn't turn on properly, don't worry. Just go through it again and make sure you followed the instructions exactly. Ask for a second opinion or discuss how you created it with someone if you're still stumped. A mistake will occasionally be revealed when you have to explain it to someone.
                </p>
                <h2>That's it!</h2>
                <p>
                    Congrats! Your very own PC has been successfully constructed! Even after this, you can continue to customise it whatever you desire in order to make it match your ideal aesthetic.
